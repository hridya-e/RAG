While stray dogs are very common here, with an estimated 1 million roaming the streets, this dog really stood out, as you are about to see: \\nFake Not only is it starving to death, but on top of that it’s entire body is covered with nasty looking cancerous tumors. The passerby who spots the dog is shaken to the core at the sight of this dog and immediately feels the compassion to get him and go to an animal-rights activist named Dalia Gámez. She immediately adopts the dog and names him Boby. She then heads to the vet where a full examination is done. \\nFake He looks to be around 2-years-old, the vets determine. Chemotherapy is administered for the tumors, with the hope that the harsh therapy won’t do damage to the spirit of Boby. To ensure he remains comfortable, Dalia stays with him throughout the treatment. Meanwhile she shares his story online. \\nFake In a two month period, Boby is required to undergo 8 chemo sessions. Even if a dog is fully healthy, that is considered a great deal. Here we have Boby, who was already at the brink of starvation. Can he actually pull through this? \\nFake Boby proves to have a spirit like no other. He braves the chemo sessions which they said only a healthy dog could go through. He then recovers rather quickly, his wounds heal, and his magnificent fur begins to flourish over his scarred up body. \\nFake Boby is now running and becoming a very popular local hero of a dog. Neighbors come and stand in line to see the dog! Now is the time to find Boby a forever home. And it doesn’t take long. \\nFake Not an easy goodbye for Dalia, as she had been through so much with Boby and experienced his miraculous transformation. But his new family is warm and welcoming, and cannot wait to provide Boby with the much love he deserves after everything he has been through. He looks like a completely changed dog and only a few scars remain. \\nFake This is proof that second chances do work and animals can indeed flourish when they are provided with love and caring. Look at Boby before. A total lost cause in so many people’s eyes. Yet a few saviors saw the potential to turn things around and they went for it. Look at Boby now!

It has been banned in Israel as it has been found to contain a so low amount of tomatoes, that it cannot even be regarded as ketchup. \\nFake Research has shown that you should eliminate Heinz ketchup from your diet and start consuming organic products instead. This ketchup type is definitely harmful to your health, and these are the main facts that prove this: \\nFake Heinz ketchup has no nutritional value \\nFake This ketchup type contains no nutrients like proteins and fibers, and it involves so reduces tomato content, that it has a microscopic lycopene amount. \\nFake It includes high fructose corn syrup \\nFake Doctors warn that consumers of Heinz ketchup have an increased risk of developing serious diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, as it includes  high fructose corn syrup made from GMO corn. \\nFake Namely, newest research has demonstrated that high fructose syrup is high in mercury, which is an extremely toxic heavy metal, and should be avoided at any cost. \\nFake It contains sugar and distilled vinegar \\nFake Heinz ketchup also contains distilled vinegar deriving from GMO corn, whose production involves pesticides and chemicals. Moreover, this dangerous ketchup also has sugar in high amounts, that is, 1 tablespoon of it has 4grams of sugar. \\nFake Hence,  its consumption will raise the sugar intake and this will lead to reduced blood sugar levels and damage to the pancreas and liver. \\nFake To sum it up, it has been found that this ketchup contains no nutrients, but is rich in chemicals, sugar, and GMOs, so it is extremely hazardous to your health. \\nFake Photos reveal end-of-life state of 35-year-old mother who drank 40 beers a day \\nFake Beverly Pickorer had been a heavy drinker for most of her young adult life, eventually getting to the point where she was drinking, on average, 40 beers each day, as reported by the Sheffield Telegraph. At age 35, the mother of four became quite ill, suffering a tragic end caused by cirrhosis of the liver. She also suffered a loss of teeth, a loss of the inability to speak, and spent years in a care facility unable to do much of anything for herself – all because of chronic alcohol abuse, as reported by Mirror UK. \\nFake Pickorer’s devoted partner, Anthony Howard, stayed by Pickorer’s side at every step, watching her health deteriorate for five and a half years before her condition reached the point in the pictures below, according to Mirror UK. Howard released the photos of his beloved partner, whom he said began drinking heavily in her early 20’s as a result of several troubled relationships. He hoped that in sharing the photos of Pickorer, he could help alert others to the very serious and potentially fatal outcomes of prolonged alcohol abuse. \\nFake According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, cirrhosis is only one of four diseases that may plague the liver as a result of prolonged alcohol abuse, the others being steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis. Alcohol also causes many other parts of the body to weaken or fail over periods of prolonged use. The pancreas produces toxic substances as a result of alcohol consumption, and this can lead to pancreatitis, a dangerous inflammation of blood vessels within the pancreas that can reduce the body’s digestive capabilities. Drinking can also affect the body’s immune system; heavy one-time consumption can affect the body’s ability to stave off infection for up to 24 hours afterward while heavily  drinking over time can make a person far more susceptible to diseases like pneumonia. \\nFake It’s important to note, however, that severe problematic drinking has been entered into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5, meaning that alcohol abuse is considered a psychological disorder, ranked in the DSM amongst disorders like depression and ADHD. While alcoholism has long carried the societal stigma of being a choice by reckless, careless individuals, it is now being viewed in a different light, with many psychologists turning the perception of addiction around and classifying it as a type of mental disorder. \\nFake According to the NIAAA, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a clinical medical condition that can be diagnosed, and approximately 17 million adults in the United States suffered from AUD in 2012 alone. AUD is diagnosed on a sliding scale – mild, moderate, sever – and is based on how many of the 11 criteria for the disorder are met by an individual in a 12-month span. Those 11 criteria are listed below: \\nFake “Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer than you intended? \\nFake More than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn’t? \\nFake Spent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over the aftereffects? \\nFake Experienced craving — a strong need, or urge, to drink? \\nFake Found that drinking — or being sick from drinking — often interfered with taking care of your home or family? Or caused job troubles? Or school problems? \\nFake Continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? \\nFake Given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you pleasure, in order to drink? \\nFake More than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt (such as driving, swimming, using machinery, walking in a dangerous area, or having unsafe sex)? \\nFake Continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem? Or after having had a memory blackout? \\nFake Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before? \\nFake Found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, or sweating? Or sensed things that were not there?” \\nFake If you or a loved one fits two or more of these criteria, it may be cause for concern, but you should never use this information as a substitute for speaking with a licensed health professional. \\nFake Pickorer’s story is a harsh reminder that the traumas of life can sometimes lead individuals down self-destructive paths, but treatment and recovery are still possible if the problem is addressed soon enough. The crippling stigma surrounding alcohol abuse can oftentimes keep suffers from seeking the help they need for fear of the judgment they will receive. Changing the perception surrounding AUD and spreading awareness of the signs, symptoms, and outcomes can help reduce the huge number of people struggling with AUD \\nFake Coconut Oil Can Make You Look 10 Years Younger If You Use It For 2 Weeks This Way '), Document(metadata={'page': 13.0, 'source': '/content/sample_data/documents/fakenews.pdf'}, page_content='she was able to leave the hospital and be placed in foster care. is Fake \\n\\x00Because of her cerebral palsy, her foster mother was told that it was doubtful that she would ever crawl or\\nwalk.

Both drugs work with the patient's immune system to fight cancer cells. \\nReal The trial compared Yervoy, the current standard postoperative treatment, with Opdivo, a newer drug. After a year of therapy, 71 percent of patients on Opdivo hadn't had a recurrence, compared with 61 percent of those on Yervoy. \\nReal “Results like this will change how we practice medicine,” said Jeffrey Weber, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone School of Medicine, who presented the findings at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology in Madrid. The results were published simultaneously online in the New England Journal of Medicine. \\nReal Weber said Opdivo was also much better tolerated by patients. Fourteen percent of patients treated with Opdivo experienced severe side effects, compared with 45 percent of patients on Yervoy. Just 5 percent of Opdivo patients had to discontinue treatment because of severe side effects, compared with 31 percent on Yervoy. The most serious problems for both treatments were diarrhea and fatigue. \\nReal Given Opdivo's superior safety and effectiveness profile, Weber said, the drug “could realistically become the new standard of care” for melanoma treatment after surgery. \\nReal Asked why Opdivo might be safer and more effective than Yervoy, Weber described Opdivo as “a sniper rifle, much more directed,” and Yervoy as “more of a shotgun.” \\nReal Both drugs are made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which funded the research. \\nReal Are we putting too much blame on ‘emotional eating’? \\nReal It’s a truth universally acknowledged that emotional eating contributes to weight gain — but is this a false truth? Many patients come to my office with the “emotional eater” label firmly affixed, convinced that if they could solve that problem, all their food and weight woes would evaporate. That’s rarely the case because emotional eating isn’t about food. \\nReal The concept was born in the 1960s, the idea being that emotional eaters couldn’t tell the difference between hunger and the physical sensations that accompany unpleasant emotions. Today, we often think of emotional eating as “feeding our feelings.” But even though we think emotions drive us to overeat, research suggests that may be more perception than reality. \\nReal Believe it, then become it? \\nReal There are a number of emotional eating self-assessment scales that quiz you about how often you feel the urge to eat in response to emotions. The problem with self-assessment is that it’s hard to accurately recall past emotions, past eating behavior, and whether there was a connection between the two. Your score may reveal more about how you think your eating is tied to your emotions than your eating behavior. \\nReal Losing weight gets personal: Diet and behavioral changes may help \\nReal Calling yourself an emotional eater could reflect conflicted feelings about your food choices — whether the amount or the perceived healthfulness — even if your eating habits are not all that different from someone who doesn’t identify as an emotional eater. Research suggests that people who are concerned about their eating behavior may retrospectively attribute overeating to emotions or stress, because emotional eating has become a commonly accepted explanation for food choices we judge as less-than-desirable. \\nReal 30 mouth-watering recipes approved by health experts \\nReal View Photos \\nReal Dietitian Ellie Krieger, Nourish Schools co-founder Casey Seidenberg and certified health education specialist Elaine Gordon offer picks for everything from breakfast to dessert. \\nReal As for those emotional eaters who actually overeat, they are also more likely to overeat when experiencing other food cues, including just being around food. Research does show that emotional eating is associated with higher body weights and more weight gain — but it’s also associated with dieting. And that’s no coincidence. \\nReal A response to restriction? \\nReal Dieting, or any restriction of amount or type of food, can lead to emotional eating due to physical and psychological deprivation, said New York-based dietitian Christy Harrison, host of the Food Psych podcast. Indeed, research shows that former and current dieters are more likely to describe themselves as emotional eaters, while those who have never dieted tend to avoid food when experiencing stress or strong emotions due to the appetite-squelching fight-or-flight response. \\nReal “Physical deprivation is when you don’t eat enough and you’re biologically hungry,” Harrison said. “People can feel like they ‘shouldn’t’ be feeling hungry because they ate ‘enough’ food according to the diet, so they blame themselves and label the eating they’re doing ‘emotional’ — instead of blaming the diet for making them so physically deprived that they can’t help but eat.” \\nReal Psychological deprivation can happen when you’ve placed a certain food off-limits, making it “forbidden.” Harrison said you can still feel deprived even after you’re physically full and satisfied. “You end up eating that food and feeling overly full — and then label that type of eating as ‘emotional’ instead of recognizing that the rule forbidding you to eat that particular food is what caused the eating, and the solution is removing the restriction.” \\nReal In a chicken-or-egg scenario, food restriction makes people more likely to overeat in response to emotional cues, but emotional eating can cause distress and guilt, potentially leading to dieting in an attempt for control. What comes first? That’s difficult to say. Further muddying the situation is the fact that weight gain can cause feelings of failure, which may lead to the desire to soothe yourself with food. \\nReal Is emotionally eating always a problem? \\nReal There’s no denying that emotional eating does offer temporary relief from uncomfortable feelings or no one would do it, and Harrison said that eating in response to emotions is normal some of the time. “What could be problematic is your relationship with food in general — are you restricting yourself and causing unnecessary distress when you end up eating things that you’ve deemed ‘off-limits’ or ‘too much’? Are you bingeing regularly in a way that’s hindering your life and causing you pain?” \\nReal Lean & Fit newsletter \\nReal Fitness and wellness trends in your inbox weekly. \\nReal Of course, psychological deprivation doesn’t just stem from food restriction — it can come from restriction in other areas of your life, such as sleep, social connection, self-care or down time. This may sound odd, but some experts call emotional eating a gift, a clear signal that your needs aren’t being met, that something needs to change. \\nReal Awareness of when you are eating to self-soothe is a first step to breaking unhelpful eating patterns, but curiosity is also key. Harrison encourages anyone who considers themselves an emotional eater to ask themselves what role dieting and deprivation might be playing. “If you recognize that you do restrict yourself from eating certain things and you feel deprived, consider that the deprivation might actually be at the root of what you think of as emotional eating — not emotions at all.” \\nFake Wi-Fi: A Silent Killer That Kills Us Slowly! \\nFake Nowadays, everyone is addicted to the internet and  the revolution of Wi-Fi network made it possible for us to use internet whenever we want and wherever we go. \\nFake Eventhough the company producing the mobile phone as well as Wi-Fi routers has to follow certain norms in order to make these devices harmful for our health, we are not completely sure if it’s totally safe to use it.

Unable to sleep, he searched for \"Spin class and sore legs\" and came across a personal account written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis. \\nRhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except dark brown urine, which he was not about to wait for, he said. \\nEverett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week. \\nRhabdomyolysis quite literally means \"breakdown of muscle,\" said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream. \\nThe condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said. \\nRecently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running. \\nI\\'ve had patients come in who can\\'t walk.
