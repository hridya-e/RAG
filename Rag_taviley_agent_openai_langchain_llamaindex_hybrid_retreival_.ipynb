Sunburns \\ncan be one of the most miserable conditions to have because it can affect huge \\namounts of your body… especially if you have been out in the sun in a bathing suit.  \\nNot only is a sunburn painful but it also makes it uncomfortable to sleep, wear clothing, \\nor even touching or rubbing the skin.  However, there are some home remedies that \\ncan help you with treating and catering to your symptoms from sunburns.  Below are \\nthe top home remedies that have been tested and proven to help with sunburn \\nconditions and pain.   \\nMilk – has been used for many years to treat sunburns.  The lactic acid and fat that is \\nfound in milk are properties that are known to have soothing qualities for sunburned \\nskin.  In this home remedy you will want to soak a soft cloth or towel in cool milk.  After \\nthe cloth or towel has been soaked you want to carefully apply it onto the areas that \\nare sunburned.  Follow this procedure for 15-20 minutes and then rinse off with cool \\nwater.  Make sure that the milk that you are using is whole milk, due to the amount of \\nfat it contains compared to skim or 2% milk.  The amount of fat found in the milk does \\nmake a difference in the effect of this home remedy. \\nAloe Vera – has to be the most effective and most common home remedy used for \\nsunburns.  Aloe Vera not only gives your skin soothing pain relief but also helps in the \\ntreatment of your sunburn.  You can take the gel extract from an Aloe Vera plant \\ndirectly or you can also find Aloe Vera gel at your local pharmacy.

There are \\ndifferent home remedies that you can use for each and both are conditions that will \\nneed to be treated for proper thyroid function.  Be sure that you are having your levels \\nthyroid levels checked periodically.  Keep a record of your TSH (thyroid stimulating \\nhormone) levels and see what home remedies work best for you and your body. \\nHyperthyroidism \\nIodine – This can be a very effective home remedy to use when treating \\nhyperthyroidism because iodine is what your thyroid glands need to function properly.  \\nYou can get iodine supplements at your local drug store and will need to contain tablets \\nthat are 225mcg.  You will also want to consume foods that are high in iodine to take \\nwith your iodine supplements.  Foods that are high in iodine are foods such as seafood, \\nbananas, eggs, meat, yogurt, oatmeal, and potatoes.  Also using iodized salt instead of \\nusing sea salt can also benefit lowering your thyroid levels.  Using iodine in your diet \\nwill naturally and effectively decrease your thyroid levels dramatically.  Try consuming \\niodine food items as well as a iodine supplement daily and watch your levels now \\nregularly in the normal average range.  \\nTyrosine - Tyrosine is responsible for producing thyroid hormones that come from \\niodine and are also a very important amino acid that your body needs.  You can find \\ntyrosine from your local drug store and is a dietary supplement.  For best results make \\nsure to incorporate this into your meal plans daily.   \\nBladderwrack – this is traditionally used to help the treatment of weight loss which is \\ncaused by thyroid problems.  Bladderwrack is a type of seaweed that has high levels of \\niodine.  You can find bladderwrack in your local drug store and can be bought in food \\nsupplement form or it can also be cooked into your brewing tea.  Both ways are \\neffective and also help increase your metabolism.   \\nCoconut Oil -   Consuming a few tablespoons daily, preferably one tablespoon after \\neach meal can help lower your overly active thyroid glands.  This is an essential oil that \\ncan help maintain a good metabolism and can also cure from an excessive weight loss.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Manju Padmasekar, a Germany-based biologist who gave birth to a baby girl after IVF treatment in \\nMumbai in 2015, agrees.\"People don\\'t want others to know that they are unable to conceive in their \\nbedroom.Somehow they find it humiliating,\" she says.
